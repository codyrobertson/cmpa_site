          The cover of the 1976 self-titled début album by the band Boston depicted several guitar-shaped spaceships, evidently escaping an exploding Earth. The album was a smash, and the visual is now iconic. It is also “dumb,” according to Paula Scher, the graphic
          designer who was responsible for it. The cover of “Boston” is one among hundreds that she designed in the nineteen-seventies (the actual illustration is by Roger Huyssen), most of them far cooler. Today, Scher is a partner in the celebrated
          design firm Pentagram, and is well known for creating innovative and memorable logos and visuals for the Public Theatre and other clients. And yet she jokingly worries, in the opening episode of the Netflix documentary series “Abstract: The
          Art of Design,” that the “Boston” packaging may end up being her most remembered work.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="content-body">

          With apologies to Scher for zeroing in on the last thing she wants to draw attention to, her good-humored dismissal of that “dumb” album cover turns out to be one of the most interesting moments in the eight-episode series (billed as the first season),
          which profiles top designers from various corners of the field. The remark makes you wonder about what, exactly, makes design good. Maybe the cover of an album that goes on to sell twenty-five million copies will be iconic no matter who designed
          it or what opinion the designer has of it later. Maybe the package design for “Boston” is better than Scher now thinks it is. Maybe the phenomenon of the “dumb” yet successful, familiar in many fields, applies equally in design.

          <br>
          <br></p>

        <p class="content-body">

          <blockquote class="typesettings"> Thinking about the potential gap between design that’s good and design that succeeds raises the obvious question: What is “design,” anyway?</blockquote>
        </p>
        <p class="content-body">


          What the show “Abstract” brings to this discussion is the implicit assumption that this discussion is over: design no longer needs championing. Design is totally cool and, apparently, pretty chic and glamorous. Each episode takes a distinct approach to
          its subject—the Fiat-Chrysler design chief Ralph Gilles, the stage designer Es Devlin (who was profiled by the magazine last year), the Nike sneaker-design legend Tinker Hatfield, all of whom are extremely stylish, sometimes to the point of
          slickness. The designers largely tell their stories in their words, with a sprinkling of endorsements from experts, colleagues, and relatives. Scher’s moment of self-criticism about that “Boston” cover is a rare moment in a series that is, for
          the most part, unapologetically celebratory.
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>

        <p class="content-body">

          The decision to explore and depict “the art of design” through a succession of thrilling-genius profiles certainly makes for solid entertainment: the episodes on Gilles and Hatfield, in particular, offer compelling portraits of their subjects, and thoughtful
          consideration of design challenges in matching form, function, and the real-world marketplace. But some choices of subjects lead to results that might seem puzzling for a series about “design.” Including an architect, Bjarke Ingels, in the series
          is almost inevitable, given how often design and architecture are, fairly or not, lumped together. But claiming Niemann as a designer seems a little backhanded to the distinct profession of illustration. And adding Platon, a terrific photographer,
          to the mix seems like a reach. (He studied graphic design in college, and cites that influence on his work.) These episodes might be a better fit for an exploration of visual expression than design.
          <blockquote class="typesettings">
            <mark>(This is as good a place as any for a perhaps overly full disclosure. The series was overseen by Scott Dadich, who until recently was the editor of Wired, which, like Gerund, is published by Condé Nast. One episode is devoted to the illustrator Christoph Niemann, a regular Gerund contributor, and another to Platon, whose photography has appeared in the magazine.)</mark>
          </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p class="content-body">This is worth pointing out because of the design disciplines that aren’t represented, at least in this season. Interaction design—which determines the way that humans use everything from Facebook to A.T.M.s—is the most obvious omission, and it
          seems surprising that digital manifestations of design in general (games, apps) wouldn’t be the subject of at least one episode. “Abstract” also leaves out a category sometimes referred to as “social” design—work by designers, across a number
          of disciplines, who try to apply design thinking to problems that can’t be solved in a way that improves some profit-driven client’s bottom line. And we certainly don’t meet anyone designing anything less than delightful—guns or slot machines,
          for instance.
          <br><br></p>

        <p class="content-body">
          There’s no question that the subjects in “Abstract” are visionaries. But there are moments when the show’s focus on spectacular, dazzling achievements—Ingels’s iconoclastic buildings, Devlin’s amazing work for Kanye West and the Olympics—makes design
          feel like an Olympian feat, rather than something that touches the everyday.
          <blockquote class="typesettings"> “Design is not just a visual thing. It’s a thought process. It’s a skill. Ultimately, design is a tool to enhance our humanity. It’s a frame for life.” </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p class="content-body">
          <br> One of the best episodes focuses on the interior designer Ilse Crawford. She’s more articulate than most on the notion of empathy as a cornerstone of design, and how the design of any given space “really affects how we feel, how we behave,”
          as she puts it. “Design is not just a visual thing. It’s a thought process. <br> <br> It’s a skill. Ultimately, design is a tool to enhance our humanity. It’s a frame for life.” The visit to her firm’s “materials library” illuminates an instructive
          discussion of how specific stone, textiles, and woods work together (or don’t) to create responses that we’re not even consciously aware of. Then again, Crawford’s breakthrough work was for <cite>Soho House</cite>, the fancy membership-only
          club for global “creatives,” and other examples in that episode skew toward posh restaurants and luxury retail. This whiff of design as the milieu of the one per cent is balanced a bit by a project to improve ikea’s restaurant spaces, but the
          claim that redesigning these interiors could have a “massive impact” isn’t very convincing.

          What useful objects there are in the exhibit resist the familiar design imperative to improve us by making us more productive or efficient or clever or fit. <cite>  (One worthy exception is a 3-D-printed “synthetic organ system,” meant to enable human survival on distant planets. The idea involves microorganisms that digest biological waste, and looks something like a Murano-glass chastity belt.)</cite>          Instead, we get 3-D-printed glass vessels and jubilant plastic fruit bowls like something constructed from dollar-store finds; sponges as prettily layered as ice-cream sandwiches and funky nail art that should never come into contact with cleaning
          supplies of any kind; a rendering of a pollutant-trapping biofilm meant to spread, mazelike, over a leaf, and silver jewelry that fits into wrinkles, highlighting rather than correcting the body’s imperfections.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="content-body">
          Many of the high-tech ideas are stunning, but so are decidedly low-tech ones, like a series of household objects—clothespins, matchbooks, staples, binder clips—set on wooden plinths by the Japanese firm Sou Fujimoto Architects, and decorated with tiny
          human figurines. Just like that, refuse becomes a ready-made architectural environment. If there’s something post-apocalyptic about the notion of making a crushed plastic water bottle into a home, there’s an optimism to it, too. A design triumph
          (it’s never been easier to carry around potable water) that became a design scourge (all those bottles sitting in landfills) is now a template for a new, whimsical way of thinking about sustainable design.
          <br><br></p>
        <p class="content-body" id="last">
          Showing the world afresh is what the best art does; making it that way is the work of design. A visitor heading out from the Cooper Hewitt into the still-light February evening (that small, significant gift of the season, sunset suddenly an hour later
          than what we expect) might stop in front of Central Park to remember another February in New York when design in the service of beauty gave us a new way of looking at things. After years of government resistance and more of planning, Christo
          and Jeanne-Claude’s Gates were installed along the park’s walkways in February, 2005: saffron panels woven like a thread through the park’s white and the grey. It was a jolting, amazing sight. People came in droves to walk and look, and look
          again. That feeling of wonder, that united epiphany, was the function of the design, but it took the form to reveal it. Beauty won the day.
