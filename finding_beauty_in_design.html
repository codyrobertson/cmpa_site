Where, in the month of February, can a New Yorker turn in search of beauty? To the window, maybe, but at her own peril; what the skies giveth, in the form of a delicate Monday-afternoon coating of snow on sidewalks and branches, they taketh away by apoplectic, skyscraper-shaking rainstorm on Tuesday morning. Safer to bet instead on synthetic splendors, like the ones parading down Fashion Week runways and onto our screens, or on display in the city’s museums, which in the late winter serve a parallel purpose to the one Central Park does in more optimistic weather, doubling as collective urban living rooms when it’s too dismal to contemplate a trip outside.
<br><br>
</p>
<p class=" typesettings content-body">
Few museums fulfill that function better than the Cooper Hewitt, located in Andrew Carnegie’s Georgian-style Upper East Side mansion, where to pass under the oxidized-copper awning and into the entrance hall, with its boiserie panelling and intricately carved oak ceiling, is to feel like a visitor to an Edith Wharton theme park before you’ve so much as checked your coat. As if to press its advantage, the museum’s current Design Triennial, which opened last weekend, is, called, well, “Beauty,” a title that comes across as a funny mix of anodyne and provocative in its winking obviousness. The discovery and contemplation and questioning of beauty is a museumgoer’s primary aim, just as creating or manipulating or disturbing beauty is the aim of the artists whose work we come to see. Beauty is the primary medium of the art-museum experience, the institution’s basic compositional unit; you could call a book “Words,” or an album “Sounds,” but why would you?

<p class=" typesettings content-body">
But in the design universe, where the usefulness of an object takes priority over the elation of the spirit, beauty has a somewhat more ambiguous value. A utensil whose four stainless-steel tines protrude from the end of a delicate, triply pronged gold-plated handle like a gleaming hand extended from a sun-kissed sleeve may propose to elevate the enjoyment of a meal by its sheer gorgeousness, but a plastic fork will also spear food and get it into the mouth. The famous adage <i>“form ever follows function,”</i> coined by the American architect <cite>Louis Sullivan </cite> and emulated by modern institutions of design from the Bauhaus to Ikea, has set the priorities of design since the end of the nineteenth century. An object has a job to do. If it looks good doing it—so good, for instance, that an Italian coffee-pot design born from Fascist initiatives to promote aluminum is still sold around the world today, and can double as a lovely urn for the son of its inventor—so much the better. Seen that way, the curators of the Cooper Hewitt show are making a bold statement by throwing their lot in with beauty, calling for a readjustment of design priorities at the risk of cozying up too close to frivolity.
<br><br></p>
<p class=" typesettings content-body">
Then again, plastic forks can be beautiful too, to say nothing of so many now-canonical Bauhaus creations, and much of what is sold at Ikea. Function may be the foundation of good design, but to act as if beauty is a lesser, ignoble consideration for designers of useful objects is to deny the artistry and imagination inherent to the work they do. It’s also to pretend to be indifferent to beauty’s enormous power, and to our own need for it, especially when it comes to the objects we interact with and rely on the most. In 1948, Max Bill, a Swiss, Bauhaus-trained architect, artist, theorist, and designer of a fantastic array of industrial and graphic items, from clocks to typefaces, lectured the Swiss Werkbund on the topic of “Beauty generated by function and as function.” Postwar industrial designers needed to recognize that the objects they would create would constitute “ <blockquote class="typesettings"> “Beauty generated by function and as function.”
</blockquote></p>

 <p class=" typesettings content-body"> <img class="text-center img-inline" src="img/design-2.jpg" alt="" data-caption="taken by: Cody Robertson"> a large part of our visual culture,” Bill said. In a world of stuff, beauty itself performs a vital, uplifting function—enough of a function to be posited as an equal part of the design equation, as the title of a collection of Bill’s essays translated into English does: “Form, Function, Beauty = Gestalt.” As predicted, we’re living in an age in which a focus on function, amplified by rapidly evolving technologies, has led to useful, gorgeous design that is more widely and affordably accessible to more people than ever before. Seen that way, the Cooper Hewitt curators are simply pointing out the realigned priorities that already govern our ever-expanding world of things.
<br><br></p>
<p class=" typesettings content-body">
Still, there is something provocative about their choice of beauty as a theme, not because we think that it doesn’t matter to contemporary design, but because we know just how much it does. Beauty, in design, is a consumer imperative, used to sell stuff: new rose-gold iPhones, new crystal-and-pearl-encrusted headphones. This is the Age of Ive, when industrial designers have an aura of rock star tinged with oracle, holding the rest of us in thrall as we wait for news of whatever elegant object will be next to emerge from the sleek, beautifully proportioned box.
And so the best thing about the Cooper Hewitt’s approach to beauty is, paradoxically, that the objects on display exist largely outside the realm of the practical, or even desirable.
 <br> <br> A headdress by the Japanese designer Maiko Takeda that looks like a dandelion made from porcupine quills, in the “ethereal” section of the exhibit (there are six other organizing adjectives: extravagant, intricate, transgressive, emergent, elemental, and transformative), is there to be gazed at; it inspires admiration without an aftertaste of covetousness. A herd of colorful beaded creatures, imagined by the American Haas Brothers and fabricated by a female weaving collective in South Africa, seems dreamed up purely to delight. A cabinet by the Finnish artist Tuomas Markunpoika, reminiscent of something found gently moldering at the bottom of the sea a century after a shipwreck, is not made to hold dishes or clothes. Markunpoika dedicated it to his grandmother, who had Alzheimer’s disease. To create it, he wrapped a regular wooden cabinet in rings of tubular steel and then burned away the wood, so that the result preserves the object’s form and instills it with a new kind of beauty, while stripping it entirely of its function.
<br><br></p>
<p class=" typesettings content-body">
What useful objects there are in the exhibit resist the familiar design imperative to improve us by making us more productive or efficient or clever or fit. (One worthy exception is a 3-D-printed “synthetic organ system,” meant to enable human survival on distant planets. The idea involves microorganisms that digest biological waste, and looks something like a Murano-glass chastity belt.) Instead, we get 3-D-printed glass vessels and jubilant plastic fruit bowls like something constructed from dollar-store finds; sponges as prettily layered as ice-cream sandwiches and funky nail art that should never come into contact with cleaning supplies of any kind; a rendering of a pollutant-trapping biofilm meant to spread, mazelike, over a leaf, and silver jewelry that fits into wrinkles, highlighting rather than correcting the body’s imperfections.
<br><br>
</p>
<p class=" typesettings content-body">
Many of the high-tech ideas are stunning, but so are decidedly low-tech ones, like a series of household objects—clothespins, matchbooks, staples, binder clips—set on wooden plinths by the Japanese firm Sou Fujimoto Architects, and decorated with tiny human figurines. Just like that, refuse becomes a ready-made architectural environment. If there’s something post-apocalyptic about the notion of making a crushed plastic water bottle into a home, there’s an optimism to it, too. A design triumph (it’s never been easier to carry around potable water) that became a design scourge (all those bottles sitting in landfills) is now a template for a new, whimsical way of thinking about sustainable design.
<br><br></p>
<p class=" typesettings content-body">
Showing the world afresh is what the best art does; making it that way is the work of design. A visitor heading out from the Cooper Hewitt into the still-light February evening (that small, significant gift of the season, sunset suddenly an hour later than what we expect) might stop in front of Central Park to remember another February in New York when design in the service of beauty gave us a new way of looking at things. After years of government resistance and more of planning, Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s Gates were installed along the park’s walkways in February, 2005: saffron panels woven like a thread through the park’s white and the grey. It was a jolting, amazing sight. People came in droves to walk and look, and look again. That feeling of wonder, that united epiphany, was the function of the design, but it took the form to reveal it. Beauty won the day.
